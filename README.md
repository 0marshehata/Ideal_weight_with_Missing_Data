# 🧠 Handling Missing Values ​​(Google Colab Version)

This notebook demonstrates how to handle missing values ​​in a dataset using **pandas** in Google Colab.

We'll:
1. Upload a CSV file
2. Inspect missing values
3. Apply three methods: Dropdown, Mean Fill, and Forward Fill
4. Compare results.

**Brief explanation:** This is a description/notes cell in the notebook, used to explain or document code.

## Cell 2 — Type: `code`

**Code:**

```python
# --- 📦 Import Libraries ---
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from google.colab import files
```

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

- Line 1: `# --- 📦 Import Libraries ---`
- A comment that explains the line or group of lines, and is not executed as code.

- Line 2: `import pandas as pd`
- Import a library or package — Used to import pre-existing functions (e.g., numpy, pandas, matplotlib).

- Line 3: `import numpy as np`
- Import a library or package — Used to import pre-existing functions (e.g., numpy, pandas, matplotlib).

Line 4: `from google.colab import files`
- Import a library or package — used to import ready-made functions (such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib).

## Cell 3 — Type: `code`

**Code:**

```python
# --- 📂 Upload CSV File ---
print("📁 Please upload your dataset file (e.g., ideal_weight_dataset_with_missing.csv):")
uploaded = files.upload()

# Get uploaded file name
file_name = list(uploaded.keys())[0]
print(f"\n✅ File uploaded successfully: {file_name}")
```

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

- Line 1: `# --- 📂 Upload CSV File ---`
- A comment that explains the line or group of lines, and is not executed as code.

- Line 2: `print("📁 Please upload your dataset file (e.g., ideal_weight_dataset_with_missing.csv):")`
- Prints a value to the output (screen) for observation or debugging.

- Line 3: `uploaded = files.upload()`
- Assigns a value to a variable (stores data in a name for later use).

- Line 4: ``
- Blank line (visual separator).

- Line 5: `# Get uploaded file name`
- A comment explaining the line or group of lines, not executed as code.

- Line 6: `file_name = list(uploaded.keys())[0]`
- Assigns a value to a variable (stores data in a name for later use).

- Line 7: `print(f"\n✅ File uploaded successfully: {file_name}")`
- Print a value to the output (screen) for observation or debugging.

print("\n❌ Number of missing values ​​before handling:")
print(df.isnull().sum())
```

**Line-by-Line Explanation:**

- Line 1: `# --- Read the Data ---`
- A comment that explains the line or group of lines, and is not executed as code.

- Line 2: `df = pd.read_csv(file_name)`
